        # Note on quality:
        # This composite workflow was repurposed from a reusable workflow and contains a lot of in-line JavaScript code
        # that is probably better off being rewritten as a native TypeScript action.
        # The in-line Javascript code is difficult to maintain due to inconsistent code highlighting and also being forced
        # to keep everything in one index.js 'file', so to speak.
        # Until an effort to refactor this workflow is made, it would be better to keep this as a 0.x.x release.
