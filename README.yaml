# Short description of this project
description: Comments on a PR when it is included in a GitHub release.

introduction: |-
  This action comments on a PR when it has commits associated with a release.

  This action should typically be called in a worklow with the `on.release` trigger:

  ```yaml
    name: PR Comment on Release
    
    on:
      release:
        types: [published]
    
    permissions:
      deployments: write
      id-token: write
      contents: write
      pull-requests: write

    jobs:
      context:
        runs-on: ubuntu-latest
        steps:
          - name: Comment on Release
            uses: cloudposse-github-actions/pr-comment-on-release
            id: pr-comment-on-release
            with:
              # Optional: only comment on PRs when the release matches a certain regex (default: ".*")
              include_regex: "^(0|[1-9]\d*)\.(0|[1-9]\d*)\.(0|[1-9]\d*)$"
  ```

  This action returns a JSON-encoded string, which contains information on the comments it created (if any):

  ```jsonc
  {
    "comments": [
      "pull_request": 1, // the PR #
      "comment_id": 12345 // the comment ID
    ]
  }
  ```
